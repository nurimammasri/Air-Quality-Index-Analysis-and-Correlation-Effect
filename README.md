## **Air pollution, Critical Component and AQI (Air Quality Index)**

Air pollution is `the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. `

There are many different types of air pollutants, such as 

* `gases` (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), 

```
PM10 - Particulate Matter
SO2 - Sulfur Dioxide
CO - Carbon Monoxide
O3 - Ozone
NO2 - Natrium Dioxide
CFC - Chlorofluorocarbon
HC - Hidrokarbon
Pb - Timah
CO2 - Carbon Diaoksida
```

* `particulates` (both organic and inorganic), and 
* `biological molecules`. 

> Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; 

> It can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). 

Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.

The population of Indonesia has increased from time to time. The increase in population has a negative impact on the environment. the availability of green land as a source of clean air in urban areas is also reduced due to the many existing green lands being converted as settlements. Thus it can be said that an increase in population can lead to reduced availability of clean air. The reduced availability of clean air can also be caused by air pollution due to motor vehicle fumes.

## **CO2 Emissions and Economic**

**Fossil fuel** has been the worldâ€™s primary source of electricity.

The majority or 50% of the installed capacity of power plants in Indonesia still comes from fossil energy. The need for electrical energy from year to year continues to increase in line with the increasing rate of economic growth, population, and the development of the industrial sector.

The use of fossil energy will produce waste in the form of CO2 gas which causes infrared radiation from the earth to return to the earth's surface so that it can cause global warming.

**Carbon tax** is a tax levied on the burning of carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The carbon tax is a core policy created to reduce and eliminate the use of fossil fuels whose burning can damage the climate.
